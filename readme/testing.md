# Testing

If you don't want to create the new account to test certain features use the credentials bellow:

## Register

Creating a new account:
- When on the login page if the user clicks 'register now!' they will be taken to the register page where the user can create a new account.
- When creating an account and all fields have been filled out and the user clicks register, the backend code will do a quick check on the username provided by    the user and check it against all the usernames in the datebase, if the username exists they will be redirected to the registration page and a message will be   flashed.
