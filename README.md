# GameScore.GG

I got the idea for this project when I was looking for A new game to play, as A was scrolling through game review sites I noticed a glaring issue that all the reviews were written and published by said websites, very few websites had a focus on user reviews.   

I wanted to build this project as a place for people to read real opinions from gamers like them and make an informed purchase decision.

 
## UX
 
My design philosophy for this project was to keep everything simple for the user side of the site. I wanted people to visit the site and discover new games, I didn't want to force anyone to make an account in order to view thing like games, developers or publishers. A user would need to create an account to review a game. I would hope seeing other users reviews would inspire other users to submit reviews too, once a user discovers a game on the site and decides that they will purchase it would be ideal if they to would return to the site to leave a review on said game. I  have added a featured games section to the home page, this way if people are only having a glance at the site hopefully they will click on one of the featured games and check some of the reviews out.
