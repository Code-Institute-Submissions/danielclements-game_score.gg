# GameScore.GG

I got the idea for this project when I was looking for A new game to play, as A was scrolling through game review sites I noticed a glaring issue that all the reviews were written and published by said websites, very few websites had a focus on user reviews.   
I wanted to build this project as a place for people to read real opinions from gamers like them, not.

 
## UX
 
For this project I wanted to create a sight that was easy to navigate and had all the information no more than 2 clicks away, for that reason I decided to go for a single page design broken in to different sections as I believe this also creates a smoother experience for the user.  


- As someone who wants to get a tattoo, I want to be able to view the tattoo artists previous work and if I like what I see I would want a way to contact him so that I can schedule a appointment.
